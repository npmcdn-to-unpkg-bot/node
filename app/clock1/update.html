make a little thing at the top that shows the current ratio of working versus idle
test it by running the busy loop that takes a second, that should record a full additional second of busy each time it happens




update every 200ms
have 50, 100, 200, 400 clocks

imagine a system that works variably
watches the working/idle ratio
uses getAnimationFrame
updates between that and 1s, depending on how slow the computer is
always obeys soon() or whatever, when something finishes, the whole thing updates immediately

and use a span for each 50, so there's wrapping that has to be calculated, too







also, for clock2, which uses
jquery
handlebars
underscore
bluebird

see how fast you can change a number on the screen with bluebird, does bluebird implement nexttick, essentially?
you're really surprised that setImmediate is a node-only thing

also, you can just do the ones that don't freeze the page








node has
process.hrtime([time])
The process.hrtime() method returns the current high-resolution real time in a [seconds, nanoseconds] tuple Array
billionth of second

the browser has
t = performance.now();
measured in milliseconds, accurate to one thousandth of a millisecond
billionth of second
