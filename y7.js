//what would it look like to make your own collections
//all you need is a linked list with an interator that you can move forward and back on
//and a set taht refuses duplcates
//and a set or list that stays sorted as you add items
//and allows removing quickly
//you could probably do this all at once with a single List that has options like staySorted and allowDuplicates
//and then classes which have to have methods like a.same(b) and a.sort(b)
//also, you need a sort() method to resort in case an item has changed, and an isSorted() method to determine if sort() is necessary



//Set, SortedSet, List, SortedList

//List
//has length, first, and last
//add() and remove(item)

//Item
//has back() and next()
//and a link back to the list it's in, check this
//and isFirst() and isLast()
//and here() or value() or something to get to what's held here

//holds
//has same() and sort()

//yeah, this looks pretty good, start writing it and some tests
//put it in list.js

//also from this you'll do TwoBoots, probably
